# Examples

This is a sample directory containing some ASM files and config files for the compile mode of river\_core.

- config-compile.ini -> A sample file for river\_core (ensure you change the plugin paths)
- testing.yaml -> Simple yaml that generates programs that will ensure that your ELF file runs with standard sample settings as mentioned in the Read the Docs
- work -> AAPG styled directory which is now supported in the river\_core compile command.
